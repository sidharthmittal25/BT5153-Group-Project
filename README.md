Here I will write what's there in the different code files:
1. The data-preprocessing and feature engineering file has all the pre-preocessing steps that we did to get the clean data; it also has codes for generating additional features which were used for making the predictions
2. Our team did extensive EDA to understand the data - hence, have segregated the EDA codes into 2 files (EDA-Part 1 and EDA-Part 2)
3. We also extracted sentiment scores from loan description - this is in sentiment and emotion score code
4. There are 3 different files for the prediction model as we tried various models; predictions (DT, RF, and XGB) has codes for decision tree, random forest and XGBoost; prediction (LR,NB and KNN) has codes for logistic regression, naive bayes, and k-nearest neighbours; prediction neural network has codes for deep neural network model
5. Recommendation file contains the code for our content-based recommendation model
6. Text summarization has codes for the extractive text summarization appraoch.

Happy Coding!
