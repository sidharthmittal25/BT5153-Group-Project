As a native of Queens, New York, I grew up among creative Asian-American culinary delights and developed a particular affinity for American ice cream. I started Noona’s Ice Cream in 2016 with a love for being a noona (meaning big sister) and passion for making Asian-inspired ice cream flavors in most surprising and delicious ways.\r\n\r\nThe first ice cream flavor I created for Noona\'s is called ""Toasted Rice"" ice cream, which became the crowd favorite at local markets. My inspiration for Noona\'s Ice Cream has always been the Korean flavors that I grew up with, and the inspiration for Noona\'s Toasted Rice flavor comes from a traditional Korean rice snack called ""Noo-Roong-Ji"". I reimagined this rice snack into an ice cream flavor by toasting raw rice then steeping it into fresh cream, so the toasty flavors of the rice infuse the cream. This flavor resonates with many people because rice is a beloved staple ingredient found in most cultures. After sharing it with family, friends, and neighbors, word spread and it wasn\'t too soon after that I began hand-delivering my ice creams all across the 5 boroughs of NYC.\r\n\r\nI like to think of Noona’s flavors as a representation of my Asian-American identity and all the people that contribute to making America a vibrant place of opportunity and change. My goal is to build an ice cream company that not only provides delicious ice cream but also mentors young people who want to become food entrepreneurs.
